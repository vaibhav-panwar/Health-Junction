Welcome to the README for the Health Junction project! This document provides an overview of the project, the technology stack used, deployment links, and includes screenshots to help you understand the project better.

## Introduction

Health Junction is a web-based healthcare appointment booking platform. Leveraging a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and bcrypt for security, I designed a user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless appointment scheduling between patients and doctors. The platform features user authentication, appointment management, doctor ,dashboards, and robust security measures

## Technology Stack

The project is built using a variety of technologies to ensure smooth functionality and an intuitive user experience:
